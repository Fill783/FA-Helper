# FA-Helper
A TamperMonkey script that adds extra functions to the FA upload page to make it easier to tag things.

Features:
```
• Easily add artist credit and links.
• Script will set the title as " - by [artist name]", and link the artist in the description.	
• The artist link will change to a twitter link if an @ is included at the start of the username.	
• Save characters to the charList and have them show up as checkboxes to automatically add character credits and tags.	
• Save groups of tags as well, in tagList, for frequently used tags.	
• Set certain words as mature or adult. If the words are added to the tags by the script, the rating changes accordingly.	
• Script will attempt to assign theme based on tags it adds. E.G: If one of the tags is "Paws", it might set that as the theme.	
• It will also attempt to assign a species if there's only one of a kind in the image, else it will leave it as "Any".	
• Script automatically changes the Category to "Digital" by default. This can be toggled off.	
• If any of your FA folders match with one of the words in the tags (Such as a character name), it will select said folders.
